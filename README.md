# Capstone-Investment_bond_Calculator

The Finance Calculator is a Python written program. 
The program allows, the user to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate the amount that should be
repaid on a home loan each month.

## Functionality

When run, this program firstly displays a menu to the user with two options of finance calculators they can access 
(i.e. investment calculator or bond/ home loan repayment calculator). Depending on which calculator the user 
chooses, the program will then prompt the user for input with a series of questions, which will capture the information 
needed to calculate either their total investment value over a certain number of years, or their monthly bond repayments 
for a set time period. For example, if the user chooses the investment calculator, they will be asked to enter the initial 
deposit amount, interest rate, number of years they plan to invest for, as well as whether they wish to invest with simple or compound interest. 
The program will then calculate the final investment value based on the user's input and display the results in an easy-to-read, informative sentence.
The same process is followed if the user chooses the home loan repayment calculator except that they will be asked for relevant input to calculate 
their monthly bond repayments (i.e. house value, interest rate and number of months planned to repay the bond).

This project was worked on individually by myself as a student in the software engineering bootcamp. However, it has been reviewed and commented 
on by the helpful mentors from Hyperion Development!
